# Introduction

Richard! develops by replicating historic natural language systems. Each of these systems has focused on some aspects of natural language, but not all of them. By integrating more and more of these systems, Richard!'s expressive power grows.

The demos serve to get you started on using the system for your particular purpose. Find a demo that looks a bit like the system you want to build, and continue from there. They also serve as integration tests to the system, and can be found in the `tests/integration` directory.

Best clone the repository into a separate directory and explore the demos from there. A demo interaction / test can be run like this:

~~~bash
python3 -m unittest tests/integration/Chat80_test.py
~~~
