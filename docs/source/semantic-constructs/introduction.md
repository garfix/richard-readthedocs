# Introduction

To say that there is no scientific consensus on linguistic semantics is an understatement. Furthermore, semantics has always been studied as part of logic, where the meaning of a sentence is taken to be its truth value. And the study of semantics is often done on a fragment of a language. Large parts are terra incognita.

The easy approach I could take in this library would be to say: defining semantics attachment is up to you. Take whichever theoretical framework you like, and good luck! But this would leave you in the dark. Composing semantics is notoriously difficult and you need any help you can get.

The fact is that the semantic constructs on the following pages are experimental. They are based on my own experience and reading books on English grammar semantics. The syntactic rewrite rules are loosely based on X-bar theory. The `find` construct was based on [Planner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planner_(programming_language)), the procedural semantics engine of [SHRDLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU). The `qnp` was based on the `quant` construct of the Core Language Engine, etc.

You are encouraged to come up with other approaches, and experiment. The library was designed to make computational semantics as simple as possible, but that doesn't mean it is. It's a struggle, and I hope you like it!
