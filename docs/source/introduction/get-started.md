# Get started

Welcome to Richard!, a Python library that translates human language into Python code. It allows you to query a database, create commands to make your computer do things, and learn the computer new words and rules.

Richard! adheres to the principle of progressive disclosure of complexity: simple systems can be built using little code, complex systems can be built as well, but require a lot more code.

The system is still very much in development, so don't expect it to work flawlessly, and the code you develop will probably not work in the next version. But you will be able to experiment with natural language understanding.

To start using the system, it's best to run a demo. After that, pick a demo that looks like the system you intend to design, and use the documentation to grow it in the direction you like. See [the introduction to the demos](demos/introduction.md)
